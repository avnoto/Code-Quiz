Code Quiz

I created this quiz using HTML, Bootstrap, my own CSS stylesheet, and Javascript.

The user will only see the floating-animated images on a medium or large screen (desktop/tablet), since they have absolute positioning and are not necessary, and the quiz container can take up the entire screen (1 col) when viewing mobile. 

The game is timed for 10 seconds to answer each question, and a 5 second inbetween-each-question timer. If the user does not select an answer in the 10 second time period, the answer will be counted as incorrect.
